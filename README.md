## What is WavPool?

WavPool is a music-sharing service where users can contribute to a boundless pool of tracks, snippets, remixes, DJ sets, and everything in between. Visitors surfing the pool can use search queries, tags, and simple browsing to discover new aural treats, and can follow their favorite users to stay up-to-date on every submission.

### Profiles
Users can create profiles with in-depth biographies and links to their other profiles across the web. Maintain your presence in the WavPool and keep your fans current.

### File upload
Upload your latest creations to the Pool for the world to hear! You can add a title and description to each track, as well as any album art for the release.

Once your file is uploaded and processed, a beautiful waveform will appear to guide listeners through the crests and troughs of your submission.

### Audio playback
WavPool provides a sleek and easy-to-use audio player for Pool surfers to queue up tracks they're interested in hearing. The player provides a small waveform and standard audio playback controls.

### Tagging and grouping
To organize your submissions, you can add tags (which are searchable as well as filterable) and group your uploads into 'sets', which can represent releases, playlists, and so on. Sets have their own titles and descriptions.

### Feeds
Follow your favorite users and watch your feed to keep up with their newest tracks, sets, and profile updates.
